  ### Ingredients
  - 500 g butternut squash or pumpkin cut into chunks
  - 250 g beetroots peeled and cut into chunks
  - 250 g sweet potato peeled and cut into chunks
  - 1 red onion cut into thin wedges
  - 150-200 g feta cheese
  - 50 g hazelnuts
  - 3 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil plus extra to drizzle
  - 2 cloves garlic crushed
  - salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - pinch chilli flakes

  ### Instructions
  #### STEP 1
  Preheat the oven to 200℃ (190℃ fan). Place 50g (2oz) hazelnuts on baking tray and toast for 4-5 minutes until golden. Set aside.

  #### STEP 2
  Place 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large bowl with a pinch of chilli flakes and 1 clove crushed garlic, mix together then add the 500g prepared squash and 250g sweet potato. Toss so that squash and sweet potato are well coated in the oil. Tip out onto one end of a large baking tray.

  #### STEP 3
  Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the bowl, some more seasoning, chilli flakes and the remaining clove crushed garlic, then add 250g(1lb 2oz) beetroots, peeled and cut into chunks and toss until coated with the oil. Tip out onto the other end of the baking sheet.
  Finally, add 1 sliced red onion to the bowl and swirl around to pick up any of the remaining oil left in the bowl then scatter on top of the other veggies.

  #### STEP 4
  Roast in the oven for 30 - 40 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Allow to cool for a few minutes.
  Roughly chop the toasted hazelnuts and crumble the feta into chunks. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and some extra oil before serving.
