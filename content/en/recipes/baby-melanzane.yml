  - 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
  - 50g dried coconut
  - 25 g unsalted peanuts
  - 20 g sesame seeds
  - 2 teaspoons coriander seeds
  - 2 teaspoons cumin seeds
  - 1 green chilli
  - ½ small bunch of fresh coriander
  - ½ teaspoon black mustard seeds

  - 1 brown onion, finely chopped
  - 1 tablespoon ginger and garlic paste
  - ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
  - ½ tablespoon Kashmiri red chilli powder
  - 250 ml coconut milk

  ### Instructions
  #### STEP 1
  Make a deep cross with a knife at the base of each aubergine.
  Soak them in heavily salted water for 30 minutes, then drain.

  #### STEP 2
  Heat some oil in a large frying pan and fry the aubergines for about 5 minutes until cooked. Drain and set aside.

  #### STEP 3
  Wipe the oil residue from the pan and dry toast the coconut, peanuts, sesame, coriander and cumin seeds for 30 seconds or until fragrant. Leave to cool then blitz in a food processor with the green chillies, fresh coriander and a little water if necessary, to form a paste.

  #### STEP 4
  Heat one tablespoon of vegetable oil and add mustard seeds and curry leaves, fry until they start to splutter, then add the onions and cook until translucent. Add the ginger and garlic parte, turmeric and chilli powder, followed by the coconut milk. Bring to boil, then turn down to a simmer, cover and cook for around 20 minutes.
  Add the aubergines to the sauce and cook for a further 10 minutes. Garnish with the fried onions and curry leaves.
