  ### Ingredients
   - egg (very fresh)
   - White vinegar
   - water

   ### Instructions
   The recipe sounds super simple, but getting the right texture of the egg yolk and a good shape can be frustrating.
   Here we share with you some tricks that we have found over time to increase the chances of obtaining a perfectly cooked egg.

   #### Trick 1
   Having a very fresh egg is certainly the most important thing. When fresh, egg white is more firm and less liquidy.
   This will greatly simplify cooking.

   #### Trick 2
   The water must not boil. In fact, boiling would "shake" the egg too much, and would ruin it completely.
   If you have a thermometer, the ideal temperature is between 80 and 87 degrees Celsius.
   If you don't have a thermometer, we recommend boiling water and then lowering the stove to the minimum and waiting for a moment.

   #### Trick 4
   A splash of vinegar in the water helps cooking of the white.

   #### Trick 3
   Use an egg at room temperature. Take it out early, or if you forgot to do it, leave it in lukewarm water for a few minutes before cooking.

   #### Trick 4
   Open the egg in a small bowl, instead of directly in the water. It will allow you to have much more control diving the egg in the pot.

   #### Trick 5
   Creating a swirl in the water helps give the egg a rounder shape.
   However, the vortex must not be too "turbulent", otherwise it will break the egg white.
   If you want to cook several eggs at the same time this step can be easily avoided.

   #### Trick 7
   The cooking time is difficult to guess, as it depends a lot on the size of the egg and the temperature of the water.
   For us, an ideal time for medium eggs and water at about 80 degrees celcius is about 3 minutes / 3 minutes and 30.
   After some experimentation, you find the right time for you.

   #### Trick 8
   If the egg is not very fresh, you can pour it into a colander before cooking it to remove the liquid part of the egg white to prevent foam from forming in the water.

   #### Trick 9
   In case you have many guests, eggs can be prepared in advance. After cooking, they must be immediately immersed in cold water to stop cooking.

   Before serving, they can be heated in boiling water for about 40s.
