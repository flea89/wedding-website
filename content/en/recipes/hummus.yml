  ### Ingredients
  - 240g cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed
  - 85g smooth tahini
  - Juice from 1 lime (or half a lemon, depending on your taste)
  - 1 garlic clove, pressed
  - tablespoons of very cold water, as needed to blend or ice cubes
  - 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
  - sea salt as needed
  - paprika, red pepper flakes, or parsley, for garnish


  ### Instructions

  #### STEP 1
  In a high-speed blender, place the chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, garlic, and salt. Use the blender baton to blend until very smooth, adding the cold water as needed to blend, and/or to reach your desired consistency. We find that one ice cube is enough to have a perfectly smooth and impeccable hummus.


  #### STEP 2
  Transfer to a serving plate, and only at this point add the extra virgin olive oil, top with desired garnishes and serve with warm pita and veggies, as desired.
