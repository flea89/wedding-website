short_desc: Perfect both in autumn and winter, these easy but gourmet toasts will make everyone happy. The perfect cheese would be the buche de chevre, which with its cylindrical shape allows it to be tender inside and with a soft crust outside.

  ### Ingredients
  - 500g red onion
  - 75g cane sugar
  - 45g butter
  - 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
  - 1,2 pinches of salt
  - 8 sourdough bread thick slices (1.5 cm at least)
  - 200g goat cheese (buche de chevre, not too strong)
  - 8 tsp Honey
  - Walnuts, time, rosemary, to your taste


  ### Instructions
  ### STEP 1
  Preheat the oven at 180ÂºC. Finely slice the onion.
  Melt the butter in a pan, then add the onion, balsamic vinegar, sugar and salt. Let it cook low heat for roughly 20/30 minutes, paying attention not to let the onions dry or burn (if necessary add 2 tbsp of water).


  ### STEP 2
  While the onions are cooking, cut the bread into slices and toast it in the oven until golden on both sides.

  ### STEP 3
  Build your toasts: cut into slices your goat cheese and spread them, add the caramelised onion and honey. Bake in the oven until the goat cheese is almost melted with a bit of crunchy crust.

  ### STEP 4
  Remove from the oven, add walnuts, rosemary or time and enjoy.
