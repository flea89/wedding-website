short_desc: Definitely THE dish that made Anna understand that Paolo was the right man for her. Dish rich in flavor and that already from the scent leaves your mouth watering, was born in France from the inventiveness of the composer Gioacchino Rossini.

  The following is not the same recipe Anna fell in love with, but a simplified version.
   For the original version we recommend this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C30oD7w2nOw).

   ### Ingredients (for 6 people)
   - 6 tournedos (central part of the tenderloin)
   - 6 slices of sandwich bread
   - 6 slices of foie gras
   - 6 slices of truffle (*)
   - 30 cl of brown stock (how to prepare brown stock)
   - 10 cl of Madeira or Port
   - 85 g of butter
   - Fine salt, white pepper to taste

   (*) in the absence of truffles, chanterelle mushrooms or Jerusalem artichokes can be used

   ### Instructions
   #### STEP 1
   Shape the slices of bread in the same shape as the tournedos, then brown them either in the oven or in a pan with 40 g of butter, then keep them warm.
   Cut the foie gras into slices, 5 to 8 mm thick, and prepare the slices of truffle (or Jerusalem artichokes, or mushrooms)

   #### STEP 2
   Heat 40 g of butter in a pan over medium heat, cooking the tournedos for 3-4 minutes on each side over high heat. The meat must have a well-browned appearance on the outside. Once the tournedos have reached a nice colour, lower the heat and cook for a few more minutes, turning them often, until they reach the desired cooking point.
   Note 1: If you want to have a perfect cylindrical shape of the tournedos, you can tie it pre-cooking with a string, to be cut then before finishing cooking

   Note 2: if you don't want to use the truffle, cook the mushrooms or Jerusalem artichokes with butter at this point, blending with Madeira or Porto.

   #### STEP 3
   Prepare the brown base and add the foie gras or truffle crumbs, if there were any during the cutting phase. Return the pan in which the tournedos were prepared, pour the Madeira (or Porto), the brown stock and add a knob of butter to make the sauce shiny, which will glaze the tournedos.

   #### STEP 4
   Arrange the bread slices on hot plates (perfect if left in a hot oven at 90ยบ C for a few minutes). Pour the sauce and place the tournedos on top, then place the slice of foie gras on top of the fillet. Add the slice of truffle, and finish it off with more sauce.
