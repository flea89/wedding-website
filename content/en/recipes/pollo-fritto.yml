  - 1 bunch of fresh coriander finely chopped

  ### Instructions
  #### STEP 1
  To make the spicy marinade mix the yoghurt, buttermilk, chilli powder,turmeric, green chillies and coriander together in a bowl. Turn the chicken thighs in the marinade so it is coated, cover and leave in the refrigerator for about two hours.

  #### STEP 2
  Pour the vegetable oil in a deep frying pan and heat until it is about 180 degrees. While the oil heats up combine the flour, cornflour, chilli powder and turmeric in a shallow bowl.

  #### STEP 3
  Lift the chicken out of the marinade and coat in the flour-mix, shaking off any excess. Deep-fry in the oil for about 5 minutes until the outside is golden brown.

  #### STEP 4
  Remove the chicken from the frying oil and drain on kitchen paper. Serve with some fried curry leaves and mayonnaise (you can add the curry leaves to the mayonnaise to give it a different flavour).
