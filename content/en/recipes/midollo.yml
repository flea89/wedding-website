  ### Ingredients (to serve 4)
  - 12 x 7-8 cm pieces of middle veal marrowbone
  - A bunch of fresh flat parsley
  - 2 shallots, peeled and very thinly sliced
  - 1 handful of capers


  <ins>Dressing</ins>
  - Juice of 1 lemon
  - Extra virgin olive oil
  - A pinch of sea salt and black pepper
  - A good supply of toast


  ### Instructions
  #### STEP 1
  Put the bone marrow in an ovenproof frying pan and place in a hot oven. The roasting process should take about 20 minutes depending on the thickness of the bone. You are looking for the marrow to be loose and giving, but not melted away, which it will do if left too long.

  #### STEP 2
  Chop the parsley, mix it with the shallots and capers and at the last moment dress with lemon, evo oil, salt and pepper.
  Toast your bread.

  #### STEP 3
  Take the bone marrow out of the oven and scrape it from the bone onto the toast, feel free to season with some coarse sea salt.
