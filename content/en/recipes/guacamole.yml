  ### Instructions
  #### STEP 1
  Use a large knife to pulverise 1 large ripe tomato to a pulp on a board (you can do this as well by putting your tomato in a freezer bag to avoid splatter scenes in your kitchen), then tip into a bowl.

  #### STEP 2
  Halve and stone the 3 avocados and use a spoon to scoop out the flesh into the bowl with the tomato.

  #### STEP 3
  Tip the juice of lime, paprika , 1 finely chopped shallot and 1 deseeded and finely chopped red or green chilli into the bowl, then season with salt and pepper.

  Use a fork to roughly mash everything together.
