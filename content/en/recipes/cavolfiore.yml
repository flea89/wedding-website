short_desc: This recipe is defined as “the vegetarians’ revenge” by Ottolenghi. It can easily substitute a main course, or be used as a side vegetable. Highly recommended to those who look for a pinch of chilliness in their life (the chilli oil can be used as well with fish and eggs!)

  ### Ingredients (4-6 people)
  - 2 large whole cauliflower with leaves (about 4 lbs)
  - 360 g onion (1 large), peeled and cut into 8 wedges
  - 8 Fresno chillies, stems on, slit down the centre
  - 1 lemon cut into wedges

  <ins>For the chilli oil </ins>
  - 90 g Rose Harissa
  - 2 1⁄2 tsp tomato paste
  - 2 tsp Aleppo chilli
  - 1 1⁄2 tsp caster sugar
  - 3 garlic cloves, crushed
  - Salt
  - 15 tbsp olive oil, plus 1 tsp olive oil


  ### Instructions
  #### STEP 1
  Trim the leaves at the top of the cauli- flowers, exposing 2 to 3 inches of the cauliflower itself. Cut each cauliflower into quarters, making sure that the leaves remain attached at the base.
  Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F.


  #### STEP 2
  Fill a large pot with well-salted water and bring to a boil. Boil the cauliflower for 2 minutes, weighing it down with a lid a
  little smaller than the pan to ensure they stay submerged. Transfer the wedges to a parchment-lined baking tray. Add the onion and chillies to the baking tray.

  #### STEP 3
  Make the chilli oil. In a mixing bowl, add the Rose Harissa, tomato paste, Aleppo chilli, sugar, garlic, salt and olive oil, and whisk to combine.
  Pour the chilli oil over the tray with the cauliflower, onions and Fresno chillies. Use your hands to toss well (wear gloves if you are sensitive to spice), massaging the chilli oil into all of the crevasses of the cauliflower.


  #### STEP 4
  Roast the cauliflower until the cauliflow- er is golden brown and crispy, 45 to 60 minutes.
  Remove the tray from the oven and baste the vegetables with the chilli oil 2 or 3 times throughout cooking.
  Transfer the roasted cauliflower to a serv- ing platter, spooning all of the remaining chilli oil and its solids collected from the baking tray over the top. Garnish with a squeeze of lemon juice and serve immediately.
