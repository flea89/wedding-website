  ### Ingredients
  - 200g self-raising flour
  - 1.5 tsp baking powder
  - 1 tbsp sugar (not mandatory)
  - 3 large eggs
  - 25g melted butter, plus extra for cooking
  - 200ml milk
  - vegetable oil, for cooking

  ### Instructions

  #### STEP 1
  Mix 200g self-raising flour, 1.5 tsp baking powder, 1 tbsp sugar and a pinch of salt together in a large bowl.

  #### STEP 2
  Create a well in the centre with the back of your spoon then add 3 large eggs, 25g melted butter and 200ml milk. Whisk together either with a whisk or electric hand beaters until smooth then pour into a jug.

  #### STEP 4
  Heat a small knob of butter and 1 tsp of oil in a large, non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. When the butter looks frothy, pour in rounds of the batter, approximately 8cm wide. Make sure you donâ€™t put the pancakes too close together as they will spread during cooking. Cook the pancakes on one side for about 1-2 mins or until lots of tiny bubbles start to appear and pop on the surface. Flip the pancakes over and cook for a further minute on the other side. Repeat until all the batter is used up.

  #### STEP 5
  Serve your pancakes stacked up on a plate with a drizzle of maple syrup and any of your favourite toppings.
