short_desc: "A great discovery indeed: the consistency comes very close to the traditional mince, creating a nice alternative to red meat. Lovely by themselves, amazing in a burger bun with your favourite condiments and sauces."

  ### Ingredients (per 4 burger)
  - 272 g grated raw peeled beets (about 2 medium beets)(*)
  - 61 g large flake rolled oats
  - 99 g cooked lentils (I used canned)
  - 63 g all-purpose flour
  - 1/2 yellow onion , finely chopped
  - 2 cloves garlic , finely minced
  - 15 ml natural peanut butter
  - 2 teaspoons dried thyme leaves
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
  - Burger sauces and bread (if you wish)

  (*) you can use pre cooked beetroots too, but they will release a bit more liquid

  ### Instructions
  #### STEP 1
  If you have a grater attachment for your food processor you can use it to grate the beets directly into the processor. If not grate beets with the grater you have, then add the beets, along with all of the remaining ingredients to the food processor. Pulse, stopping to scrape the sides, until the mixture comes together.

  #### STEP 2
  Form into 4 patties. The patty mixture will be very sticky, so wet your hands in between forming each patty, to help stop the sticking.

  #### STEP 3
  At this point you have a life choice to make:
  - fry the patties (there should be no second option
  - bake the patties

  <ins>To fry the patties:</ins> heat enough oil to cover the bottom of a large skillet over medium heat. When hot, add the patties. Cooking them low and slow is the key for good texture. Cook about 3 to 5 minutes per side, until they are nicely browned on both sides and hold together well. Serve hot on a bun with your favourite burger toppings.


  <ins>To bake the patties:</ins> preheat your oven to 350F (180C). Lightly grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.
  Lay the patties out in a single layer with room around them for air to circulate. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, flipping halfway through until firmed up and lightly brown on both sides.

  #### STEP 4
  Serve hot on a bun with your favourite burger toppings.
