category: Mains
short_desc: A dish that left us without words in our Iceland trip in 2019 and we recooked a few times back home. A bit of patience is needed because of the two broths (fish and langoustine) but its final creaminess and taste will make the effort worth it!

  ### Ingredients
  Per il brodo di scampi
  <ins>Stock</ins>
  - 2 tablespoons butter
  - 500 g of langoustine shells (or shrimp/lobster/prawn shells)
  - 180 ml dry white wine
  - 1 yellow onion (chopped into quarters)
  - 2 carrots
  - 2 celery stocks
  - 4 cups fish stock
  - 3 cups water
  - 1 teaspoon pepper
  - 1 teaspoon salt

  <ins>Soup</ins>
  - 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
  - 4 tablespoons butter
  - 2 garlic cloves (finely minced)
  - 1 yellow onion (finely minced)
  - 1 tablespoon tomato paste
  - 2 teaspoons paprika
  - 1 tablespoon curry powder
  - 240 ml dry white wine
  - 1.5 l stock (prepared in the first step)
  - 500 g of langoustine (or shrimp/prawn, shells used for stock)
  - 350g Yogurt (can also use heavy cream)
  - 60 g chopped fresh chives (for topping)
  - 2 tablespoons heavy cream (for topping)


  ### Instructions
  #### STEP 1 (The Stock)
  In a medium-size saucepan over medium heat, heat butter until melted. Next, remove shells from shellfish and add to pot.
  Chop onion into quarters and add to pot along with carrots, celery, fish stock, water, and salt and pepper.

  Bring stock to boil. Once boiling reduce heat to simmer and allow to simmer for 1 hour (or until you roughly have 1.5 litres of stock).
  After stock has simmered, strain the stock into a bowl and set off to the side to be added to the soup later on.


  #### STEP 2: (The soup)
  In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat butter and olive oil.
  Once the butter and oil is hot add the minced onion and garlic.
  Allow the onion and garlic to soften, stirring occasionally for roughly 3 minutes. Next, add the tomato paste, paprika, curry powder, and wine to the pan and allow to simmer for roughly 5 minutes.


  #### STEP 3
  Next, add the reserved stock and simmer for 30 minutes.

  Once soup has simmered, add shrimp and cook for another 5-10 minutes. Remove soup from heat and allow the soup to cool slightly before stirring yoghurt into the soup (this will help ensure that the yoghurt does not separate). Serve immediately and top with a drizzle of cream and chopped chives.

  Add additional sea salt and pepper to taste.
