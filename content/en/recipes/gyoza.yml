  ### Ingredients (makes 15-20)
  <ins>For pork filling:</ins>
  - 200g pork mince (15% fat)
  - 3x Chinese chives
  - Salt and pepper
  - Light soy sauce
  - 20g ginger sliced and soaked in one cup of water
  - Sesame oil
  - Amoy Chicken Power (optional)

  <ins> For dumpling dough: </ins>
  - 1/2 cup of warm water
  - 2x cups of all purpose flour

  If you don't have time to make dough, it can be purchased in ethnic Chinese or Japanese supermarkets.

  Chinese vinegard and chillie oil for the dipping sauce

  ### Instructions

  #### STEP 1
  Pour your flour into a bowl and make a hole in the middle. Pour 1/2 cup of warm water into the hole and mix.

  #### STEP 2
  Use your hands and knead the dough until smooth and then cover and rest for 10mins. Uncover and knead the dough again until it becomes quite elastic then cover and rest for a further 20mins.

  #### STEP 3
  While that's resting, break up the pork mince in a bowl and put 3x tbs of the ginger infused water into the minice, stir until it has absorbed all of the water.

  #### STEP 4
  Remove the white ends of the chives and finely chop them. Mix them through the pork mixture. Add 1x tbs of light soy sauce, 1x tsp sesame oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper into the mixture and stir thoroughly. Add half a teaspoon of chicken powder if you'd like.

  #### STEP 5
  Get your dough and roll into a 1cm thick cylinder. Pull off enough to roll into a 25mm ball.

  #### STEP 6
  Flatten the ball with the palm of your hand. Roll it out until it's about 10-12cm in circumference.

  #### STEP 7
  Add a ball of the mixture onto the dumpling skin but leave 5mm space around the edges. Fold in half and pinch the top. Place your index finger in between the two flaps of dough and use your middle finger to bring the skin from the side in and pinch. Repeat this three times on both sides until the dumpling is sealed.

  #### STEP 8
  Boil a pot of water and place dumplings inside. Once they reach the surface, take them out and serve with Chinese vinegar mixed with some chilli oil as a dipping sauce.

  Another way you can cook them is by pan frying them with a tbs of oil. Once the dumplings start sizzling in the pan add half a cup of water and cover. Once the water evaporates which takes about 8 mins (longer if you're cooking from frozen) they'll be ready to serve. These are called Gu≈çtie (pot sticker dumplings).
