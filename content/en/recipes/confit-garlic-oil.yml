short_desc: This is the ideal condiment to have on hand anytime you want to add a warm, mellow garlic flavour to a dish. Cooking the cloves slowly leaves them slightly sweet â€“ perfect as a garnish or for mashing into a confit. You also get a lovely garlic-infused oil that can be drizzled over salads or used for dipping bread. You can play with this recipe by adding other aromatics to the oil (sage leaves, or orange or lemon skin).
