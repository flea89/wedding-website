short_desc: Recipe originally coming from the Basque region, it incredibly melts together sea and earthy notes. If you like those spices, feel free to add in the grilling pan some paprika and chillies.

  ### Ingredients (serves 4)
  - 1 3/4 pounds octopus tentacles
  - 5 ounces cured Spanish chorizo, cut into 1/2-inch dice
  - 1 onion, coarsely chopped
  - 3 bay leaves
  - 3/4 pound potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice
  - 2 teaspoons chopped thyme
  - 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
  - Kosher salt
  - Freshly ground pepper


  ### Instructions (per 4 persone)
  #### STEP 1
  Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil with the onion and bay leaves. Using tongs, carefully dip the octopus into the boiling water 3 times, then leave it in the water. Cook the octopus over moderately low heat until tender, about 1 hour. Remove from the heat and let the octopus stand in the water for 10 minutes; drain. Cut the octopus into 1/2-inch pieces.


  #### STEP 2
  In a medium saucepan, cover the potatoes with water and add salt. Bring to a boil and simmer over moderate heat until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl. Toss the potatoes with the 3 tablespoons of olive oil and the thyme; season with salt and pepper.


  #### STEP 3
  In a grill pan, cook the chorizo over moderately high heat until warmed through, 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Add the potatoes and octopus to the pan and cook until hot and the potatoes are golden in spots, 5 minutes. Add to the chorizo, season with salt and pepper and toss. Drizzle with oil, and serve.
