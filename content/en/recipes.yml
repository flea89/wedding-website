  Cooking has been, from the beginning of our story, a shared passion, a challenge, a ritual that brough us closer to each other, both home and while travelling.

  The time that we dedicate to more demanding recipes over the weekend or for special occasions has great value for us. And it acquires even more if the preparations are also tasted by those closest to us. During the week, when time is scarce, we try as much as possible to find variations and alternatives to quick recipes, so that we can better appreciate the food even in moments of tiredness.

  As a momory of our wedding, we have decided to write for you our collection of "trusted" recipes, which we have repeated several times together in the kitchen, in the hope that they will bring just as much satisfaction and smiles from you too.

  The recipes have various origins: the Middle East, India, Iceland, China, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. Some have been calibrated or invented from scratch by us, others extrapolated from books or blogs dear to us (in this case we will always write you the source, if you are interested in finding out more about their author).

  Have fun!
